# Python Live Training Template

To get yourself started with setting up your live session, follow the steps below:

1. Fork this repository into your own personal GitHub.
2. Download and install the "Open in Colabs" extension from [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo?hl=en). This will let you take any jupyter notebook you see in a GitHub repository and open it as a **temporary** Colabs link.
3. Upload your dataset(s) to the `data` folder.
4. Upload your images, gifs, or any other assets you want to use in the notebook in the `assets` folder.
5. Check out the notebooks templates in the `notebooks` folder, and keep the template you want for your session while deleting all remaining ones.
6. Preview your desired notebook, press on "Open in Colabs" extension - and start developing your content in colabs _(which will act as the solution code to the session)_.  :warning: **Important** :warning: Your progress will **not** be saved on Google Colabs since it's a temporary link. To save your progress, download the updated notebook and re-upload it in the `notebooks` folder. You can also develop your content locally and upload the final version to the `notebooks` folder of this repository, however make sure all the syntax and functions you use are supported and running as expected in Colabs.
7. Once your notebooks is ready to go, create an empty version of the Notebook to be filled out by you and learners during the session, end the file name with `_learners.ipynb`. 
8. Create Colabs links for both sessions and :tada:
